        In this survey, you will help us evaluate a novel method for understanding the content people interact with on their screens. 
        Traditionally, content analysis focuses on app names (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Google Chrome) and app categories 
        (e.g., social, communication, gaming), but this approach only offers a surface-level view of user behavior.""")

        **How to interact with the scatter plot:**
        There are many ways to interact with this plot, and you can select one or multiple to make the most out of your experience.
        - **Hover**: Hover over the points to see more information, including the app name, category, and a brief description.
        - **Toggle topics**: Click on a topic in the legend to show or hide points related to that topic. This can help you see the distribution of the topic's points in the plot.
        - **Zoom**: Double click, or use your trackpad(2 fingers up) to zoom into specific area. Use trackpad(2 fingers down) to zoom out.
        - **Annotations**: See the labels for each topic directly on the plot.
        - **Search**: Search for a specific metadata(a specific app or a keyword) using the search bar. This search is pretty basic,  works as a quick filter.

        Take a few moments to explore this interactive plot. Once you're comfortable, click "Next" to proceed to the actual survey.

            2. **Our Method - Content-Based Clustering:** Next, you will see the same visualization colored by inferred topics based on the content of the screenshots.
            3. **Compare Baseline with Our Method:** Last, you will answer the survey questions to assess the usefulness and informative value of content-based clustering in comparison with the baseline.
